Unicorn Remote is a web based remote control for the Unicorn HAT LED matrix. It allows you to control light grid programs from a desktop or mobile browser and a web API.

Supports both the new Unicorn HAT HD 16x16 and original Unicorn HAT 8x8. It comes with a built-in set of programs for both, and allows you add your own.

The [Unicorn HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat) and [HAT HD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat-hd) are available from Pimoroni.
